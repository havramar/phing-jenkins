What's new:
* added phplint target for fast linting,
* added jshint target,
* phpcs uses PSR2 standard,
* phpunit with parameters to generate coverage reports (no need to define them in phpunit.xml file),

To install all dependencies add to your `composer.json`:

```
"require-dev": {
    "phing/phing": "2.8.*",
    "phpunit/phpunit": "4.2.*",
    "pdepend/pdepend": "2.0.*",
    "phpmd/phpmd": "2.1.*",
    "sebastian/phpcpd": "2.0.*",
    "squizlabs/php_codesniffer": "1.5.*",
    "phploc/phploc": "2.0.*"
}
```

Those are mainly the config files from http://jenkins-php.org/ with some changes to use with PHING, instead of ANT.

The job template to use can be found under https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-jenkins-template.
