What's new:
* added phplint target for fast linting,
* phpcs uses PSR2 standard,
* phpunit with parameters to generate coverage reports (no need to define them in phpunit.xml file),

Those are mainly the config files from http://jenkins-php.org/ with some changes to use with PHING, instead of ANT.

The job template to use can be found under https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-jenkins-template.
